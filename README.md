                               Stress Prediction in Working Employees Using Neural Networks.

Abstract:


Increasing amount of workload and changing lifestyles contribute to high stress level among employees.Employees working in IT 
industry are prone to develop a lot of health problems due to continuous physical and mental stress of their work. 
Diseases are either induced, sustained or exacerbated by stress. A lot of minute factors contribute towards this stressful nature 
like gender,employee status,income,etc.
Here the data from "OSMI Mental Health In Tech Survey 2019" was taken into consideration.This project aims 
towards determing the factors that strongly contribute towards stress levels by analyzing using various Machine Learning techniques 
like decision tree,regression,etc after data preprocessing. Using deep learning techniques like CNN (Convoluted NeuralNetworks) 
and verify how the model performs for the given dataset is also the goal ,this project focuses on implementing various techniques 
and analyzing them also gives an insight of the accuracy provided by these algorithms as well as some hidden 
attributes contributing to the same.This can be useful for the industry as well the employess to analyze thereby reducing 
stress levels and provide better environment in the workplace.
